Keystone Init Scripts
=====================

These scripts allow to init keystone database and migrate
users/project/roles from nova to keystone database.

To setup keystone database, run::

    # sudo -u keystone ./init-keystone-db.py nova=127.0.0.1 glance=127.0.0.1 identity=127.0.0.1 magic=999888777666

Substitute appropriate hosts for nova, glance, and identity (i.e. keystone) services.
``magic`` is admin's magic token that is still saved in numerous places at OpenStack.
Usually, magic token is 999888777666.

This script will add default tenant, user, roles, services, and endpoint templates.

To migrate from nova database, check your nova.conf for an adequate --sql_connection and run as root::

    # ./nova2keystone.py
    # chown -Rv keystone /var/*/keystone
